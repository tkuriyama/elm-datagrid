## Browser Compatibility

**Something seems broken..?**

| Browser | Compatibility                     |
|:--------|:----------------------------------|
| Chrome  | Supported                         |
| Safari  | Partial Support (some CSS issues) |
| Other   | Not Tested                        |

**Why do the interactive elemnts not work?**

In addition to general browser compabitility, some browser extensions may cause issues (if they also rewrite pages, like screen readers or dark modes). 

For Dark Reader users: setting the Mode to `Filter` instead of `Dynamic`usually resolves any issues.


## Semantics

**What does this chart mean?**

Some of the charts like bar charts and line charts are (hopefully) self-explanatory; others are more original.

## Browser Compatibility

### Something seems broken..?

| Browser | Compatibility                     |
|:--------|:----------------------------------|
| Chrome  | Supported                         |
| Safari  | Partial Support (some CSS issues) |
| Other   | Not Tested                        |

### Why do the interactive elemnts not work?

In addition to general browser compabitility, some browser extensions may cause issues (if they also rewrite pages, like screen readers or dark modes). 

For Dark Reader users: setting the Mode to `Filter` instead of `Dynamic`usually resolves any issues.
